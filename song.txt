Deep in my heart, there's a fire, a burnin' heart
Deep in my heart, there's desire for a start
I'm dying in emotion
It's my world in fantasy
I'm livin' in my, livin' in my dreams
You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, a feelin' that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That is the only thing I really know
